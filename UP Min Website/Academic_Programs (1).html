                    <h3>Master in Management</h3>
                    <div>
                      <p>Today’s world of work is more complex and volatile than it was years back. Managerial problems, especially those faced by decision-makers at the highest levels of administration, have become less structured than they were in the past.  Increasingly, managers have to deal with more sophisticated technologies, more rapidly expanding and contracting markets.  In adapting to these changes, organizations have become flatter, smaller and more flexible in structure, more integrative in approach to decision-making, and more global in operation.
                        <br><br>
                        Given the dynamism of our present work environment, it becomes imperative for organizational leaders to develop the capability to assess a broad spectrum of interrelated issues and to interpret a continuous stream of data that are vital to decision-making.
                        <br><br>
                        Decision-makers ought to be humanistic because people are the carriers of today’s most important resources (knowledge and information), and holistic because managerial problems and issues are interrelated.

                        <br><br>
                        <br>* Innovativeness – ability to develop approaches in applying new and continually evolving stock of knowledge and information
                        <br>* Proactiveness – the ability to anticipate problems and issues to set the tone for change and develop orientation or concern for the enhancement of the human condition in the long run
